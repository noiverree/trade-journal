Trading involves buying and selling financial instruments to profit from price movements, typically over a shorter period than investing. While often compared to gambling due to its speculative nature, a key difference is the concept of "edge." Unlike gambling, where the odds favor the house, trading operates as a zero-sum gameâ€”one trader's gain is another's loss. This means that while the market doesn't inherently favor any participant, a trader can develop an edge through strategy and risk management. Unlike a gambler who is bound to lose over time due to the house advantage, a skilled trader can sustain profitability by consistently making better-informed decisions than their counterparts. [^1]

This personal journal will explore various technical tools, charting techniques, and psychological aspects of trading, along with key concepts that can help refine my decision-making process.

It will serve as both a guide and a reflection tool. By analyzing both technical patterns and psychological factors, I aim to develop a stronger edge in the market, enabling me to make more informed, strategic, and disciplined trading decisions.
