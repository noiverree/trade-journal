## Support and Resistance

​**Support and resistance** are fundamental concepts in technical analysis, used by traders to identify potential price levels where an asset's movement may pause or reverse. [^1]

Technical analysis recognizes that stock prices constantly fluctuate due to supply and demand. By focusing on price movements within a specific timeframe, traders aim to identify patterns. A stock’s price may hold at a **support level**, preventing it from falling further, or face a **resistance level**, where buying pressure weakens and the price struggles to rise. [^1]

### Support

In a downtrend, prices fall because supply exceeds demand. As prices drop, they become more appealing to buyers waiting on the sidelines. [^1]

At some point, demand gradually increases until it matches supply, causing the price to stop falling. This level is known as **support**. [^1]

Support can appear as a single price level or a broader price zone on the chart. It represents an area where buyers step in with enough strength to prevent further declines. When demand overwhelms supply at this level, the downtrend often halts and reverses. [^1]

### Resistance

**Resistance** is the opposite of support. Prices rise when demand exceeds supply, but at some point, selling pressure overtakes buying, preventing further increases. [^1]

This can happen for various reasons—traders may believe prices are too high, have reached their targets, or buyers may be hesitant to enter at elevated levels. [^1]

Regardless of the cause, a trader can identify resistance on a price chart as the level where supply starts to overpower demand. Like support, resistance can appear as a specific price level or a broader zone. [^1]

Once a support level is broken, it often **becomes a new resistance** as the price attempts to rise again. Conversely, a broken resistance level can turn into **support** when the price pulls back. [^2]

## S&R Zones

Technical analysis is not an exact science. Prices may occasionally dip below support levels or reverse before reaching them. The same applies to resistance—prices might turn around before hitting a previous resistance level or break through it entirely. [^1]

Because of this, **flexibility** is key when interpreting chart patterns. Support and resistance are often viewed as **zones** rather than fixed numbers, reflecting the natural variability in price movements. [^1]

Above is a chart of Euro/U.S. Dollar (EUR/USD) traded on the FXCM platform within a one-day time frame during January-February 2025. [^3] It drawn a line as it's support level. Notice how some price fluctuations dip below the line.

This is the same chart, but with support zones drawn instead, accounting for price fluctuations.

## Level of Significance

Not all support and resistance levels have the same significance; they vary based on several factors. Traders often identify these levels and assess their significance by considering:
 - Number of touches – The more times a level is tested, the stronger it becomes.
   <br>
 - Preceding price move – Sharp advances or declines make levels more significant.
 <br>
 - Volume at key price levels – High trading activity reinforces support and resistance.
 <br>
 - **Time** – Levels that hold for a longer period tend to be more significant. Support and resistance levels formed on higher timeframes (such as daily or weekly charts) carry more weight than those on shorter timeframes.
