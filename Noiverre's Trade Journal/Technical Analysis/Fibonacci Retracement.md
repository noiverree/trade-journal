## Fibonacci Sequence

The **Fibonacci sequence**, introduced to Western mathematics by Leonardo of Pisa (known as Fibonacci) in the 13th century, is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. [^1] This sequence is closely related to the golden ratio, approximately 1.618, which appears in various natural phenomena and has been applied in fields like science, architecture, and finance. [^2]

## Applications in Trading

Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines on a financial chart that indicate potential support and resistance areas during a price pullback. Derived from the Fibonacci sequence, these key levels include 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. Traders use these percentages to identify where a security's price might pause or reverse within its trend. [^3]

Traders utilize Fibonacci retracement levels to determine strategic points for entering or exiting trades, setting stop-loss orders, and establishing price targets. These levels are often combined with other technical analysis tools, such as moving averages and trendlines, to enhance trading strategies. However, it's important to note that while these levels can indicate potential support and resistance areas, they should not be used in isolation, as false signals can occur. Therefore, traders often use Fibonacci retracement levels in conjunction with other analysis tools to improve the reliability of their trading decisions. [^3]

## Implementation

The chart above shows the Euro/U.S. Dollar (EUR/USD) traded on the FXCM platform within a one-day time frame during July-August 2013. [^4] Based on the chart, the highest price point (pivot high) was 1.33417, while the lowest price point (pivot low) was 1.27562. If the price were to drop back down to 1.27562, it would represent a full (100%) retracement of its previous upward movement.

In this situation, a trader who is bullish on EUR/USD is looking for a good entry point. They mark the pivot high (1.33417) and pivot low (1.27562) on their charting platform and wait for the price to retrace before making a move.

The price pulls back, retracing to the 38.2% level. Seeing this, the trader enters a long position, placing a stop-loss slightly below the 61.8% retracement level and setting a target at the previous pivot high.

After some time, a check reveals the position remains positive and hasn't returned to the previous pivot high. The trader exits with profit.
