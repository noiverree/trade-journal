Here are some key settings for my TradingView chart style. From candlestick colors to tweaking the look of different tools, I want everything to be clean, easy on the eyes, and functional. This is where I keep track of the adjustments I make so I donâ€™t have to redo everything from scratch if I ever reset my setup. This setup is heavily inspired by "Bloomberg Terminal" style found in *chartthemes*, a website providing themes for TradingView chart styles. [^1][^2]
